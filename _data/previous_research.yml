  description: "While the Weak Propagating (WP) MJO exhibits a somewhat similar circulation and MSE pattern, some discrepancies clearly exist. First, the amplitudes of circulation and MSE anomalies of WP MJO are significantly weaker than those of Strong Propagating (SP) MJO. Second, the downward and eastward extension of positive MSE anomalies in WP MJO appears to move further eastward (170°E) as compared to the SP MJO (150°E). Accordingly, the descending center is displaced further eastward across the dateline to force a wider Kelvin wave response in the lower troposphere as denoted by the further eastward extension of easterly winds and MSE anomalies on the longitude-latitude diagram (see Figs. a and b for comparison). In contrast, the Eastward Decaying (ED) MJO displays an extremely weak response and a more upright structure, with little sign of downward and eastward extension of positive MSE anomalies. "
