title: "About Me"
content: |
  I am Yu-Cian Tsai, a Ph.D. candidate in Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University, working with Prof. Eric Maloney. My research focuses on subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) prediction, particularly the interactions between the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), easterly waves (EWs), and tropical cyclones (TCs). I am investigating how the MJO influences TC genesis over the eastern Pacific and the broader implications for S2S prediction skill.

  Currently, I am exploring the prediction performance of the Unified Forecast System (UFS) models, diagnosing pre-TC disturbances, and studying the role of eddy kinetic energy (EKE) in EW dynamics. I am passionate about understanding and improving S2S model performance to enhance weather and climate predictions.
